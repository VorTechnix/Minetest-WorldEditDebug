# WorldEditDebug Changelog
Hey, I remembered to make a changelog! (Now let's see if I remember to update it :dizzy_face:)

This will be the main changelog for WorldEditDebug.

## v0.2: The Second Beta Release! (unknown)

 - Created `//posdump`

## v0.1: The First Beta Release! (8th July 2021)

 - Created initial chat commands: `//benchmark`, `//benchlog` (outputs benchmark results to text file), `//bpreg` (_break point register_), `//debug`, `//log`
 
 - Created function library for chat command dependencies


## Updating

Right now WorldEditDebug is only on github and that probably won't change until it leaves beta.

 - Github: [Download the zip file](https://github.com/VorTechnix/Minetest-WorldEditDebug/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) of the main branch and extract it to the Minetest mods folder.
 - Git: `cd` to the WorldEditDebug directory and run `git pull`

After installing the update, don't forget to restart your client and / or server.
